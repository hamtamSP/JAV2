## JAV² Tree Planting Vehicle

The JAV² Tree Planting Vehicle is inspired by the [#teamtrees](https://teamtrees.org/) initiative to plant 20 million trees before 2020. Hence, we created a Tracked Vehicle that can travel through uneven terrain to plant seeds so that they can turn into trees. The JAV² Tree Planting Vehicle is designed to be controlled through Wifi with a mobile device to enable it to plant the seeds in remote areas.
