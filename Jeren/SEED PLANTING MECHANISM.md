# Seed Planting Mechanism
***
I was task to make a back-up plan in case the drilling mechanism did'nt work.
***
### Ideas
* Rather than putting the seed under the soil, maybe we could put soil over the seed
    * The problem with this is that the soil will give addition weight and maybe too much for the vehicle. It will also require another mechanism to dispense the soil.

Mr Tune said that putting the seed into the ground is very hard to do, recommends to just dispense the seed onto the ground, so i will be focusing on that.

### Prototype
Prototype 1

![Seed1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamtamSP/JAV2/master/Jeren/Seed1.png)![Seed1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamtamSP/JAV2/master/Jeren/Seed1.2.png)

This design requires a belt attached to the top of the case and to a servo, Seed will be loaded into the hole at the top. The servo turns, causing the case to turn as well due to the belt. The angled stand will allow the the seeds to continuously fall.
The problem is that the seeds cannot stop falling.

Prototype 2

This prototype lets the seed fall into a pathway. The seeds should be pushed out by a gear. The gear is moved by the servo.
The problem the seed may get jammed by the gear and stop working, so it was discontinued. :(

Prototype 3

![Seed3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamtamSP/JAV2/master/Jeren/Seed3.png)

This prototype uses a screw to dispense the seeds. The seed will be loaded at the top and will drop in to the tube. The screw will push the seeds out by turning, moved by the servo. Vincent fixed some problems like seed jamming. He made the tube have a guiding path for the seed so that it won't get jammed (Though there may still be jamming sometimes). The stand allows the prototype stand onto the casing made by Vincent so that it can be assembled seperately and easily.
