# Casing Creation
***
I was given the task to creating the casing of the tracked vehicle.
***
These designs were drawn by Vincent that i used as a reference.

I used inventor to create 3 versions of the casing
***
Version 1

This version is the basic casing where I follow the given design, There are holes at the front for mounting the esp32. The 2 slots on the base is for mounting onto the main chassis. There are 2 slots on the back wall. It is so that users can add any parts via an additional box. There is a gap on the back wall for the wires to run through.

Version 2

This version has more accurate dimensions for almost all the holes and slots.

***
Version 3

This version has the mounting slots on the side as I thought is may be a better variant for the casing.

From here on, I used Fusion 360.
***
Version 4

I realised in the previous versions that due to the height of the walls, the assembly would be difficult as there is little space for tools and hands. So the main point of this is the lowered walls which would give easy assesibility. There is an extra stand for the ultrasonic sensor so that is is properly mounted. The slots to mount on to the main chassis were also changed to hole so that it would not move as much as before. There is a hole on the right wall for a toggle switch. The hole positions were a big problem for me.

Version 5

For previous versions, i was thinking that it would be entirely produced through 3D-printing. But for this version, most of the parts would be produced through laser cutting. As seen in the image, there are a lot of holes. The holes are so that any components can be placed in the casing, rather than having the casing be used for this specific project. The back wall is curved. It works together with the slots on the wall to hold the extra compartment at the back. The wires will run through the holes of the back wall rather than a gap in the wall. The ultasonic sensor is made to face toward the floor, as requested by Vincent. The right side has three holes as seen on the image. The round hole is for the toggle switch. The 2 rectangular holes are for the usb, They are bigger than the required dimensions as Arian requested for space so that users can look for light.
For the assembly of this version, there are slots for fitting the workpieces. It kind of works like puzzle pieces.
