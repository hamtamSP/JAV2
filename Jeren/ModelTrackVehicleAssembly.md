# Assembling a model tracked vehicle
##### Week 3
***
## Introduction
For this week, we were given an unassembled tracked vehicle so that we can assemble. The parts will eventually become the base of our actual tracked vehicle after modifications.

What we used for this week:
* Mini T100 Tracked Tank Chassis (Silver with 12V motor)

We followed this guide to assemble the driving and bearing wheel of the vehicle.

We found a video for installing the tracks of the video.

But in the end we found a video to assemble the whole tank, which make the other 2 guide kind of useless.
