#### Maximum Incline
When vehicle is not moving:
Max. Incline = tan-1 (μs) , μs = surface coefficient
Dirt: Smooth = 1.43° , Sandy = 2.12°
Mud: Firm = 2.12° , Medium = 5.14° , Soft = 8.5°
When vehicle is moving:
θmax = 3.12°

#### Seed Dispensing Power Requirement
![Screw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamtamSP/JAV2/master/Jeren/Screw.png)

Mass of 1 green bean = 0.5g = 0.0005kg
Mass of 10 beans 	 = 0.005kg
Mass of the screw 	 = 6g = 0.006kg
Total Mass = 0.011kg
Angular Torque:
𝜏 = mrα
α = driver speed x π /       acceleration time x 30
   =330π
𝜏 = (0.011)(0.0075)(330π)
   = 0.0855Nm
Power = 𝜏 x 2π/30 = 0.018W
