## Continuous tracks
#### Structure
* Band of Treads
* Track Plates driven by two or more wheels

#### Characteristics
* Large Surface Area

#### Advantages
* Better weight distribution compared to wheels
* Easy to transverse **Soft Ground with Less Likely to Get Stuck**

#### Types

[Lighter Agricultural Machinery]
* *Modern* - soft belts of synthetic rubber, reinforced with steel wires

[Military/ Heavy Construction Vehicles]
* *Classic* -  solid chain track made of steel plates (Caterpillar Track/ Tank Tread)

## Assignment
    Individual Assignment 1

    After the briefing on the method of sizing a motor for tractive purposes, everyone needs to do an individual assignment with this problem statement:


    A grocery transportation drone is being designed. It will have continuous tracks as the method of propulsion. Only one sprocket axis is powered.

    What electrical motor(s) need to be bought to power it? Budget constraint for motor(s): USD100 in total.


    Functional constraint:

    Vmax = as fast as possible but limited only to motor's max rpm

    Acceleration time to Vmax = any number between 1 to 5 seconds (should be unique between students).

    Maximum incline = BCA-approved wheelchair ramp incline (find out and cite source)

    Weight = 1kg + weight of groceries

    Weight of groceries = combined weight of 5-6 randomly choose bulky goods from Redmart or Fairprice's website and cite their individual weights and their combined weight. This combo should be unique between students.

    Graph of Tw vs Acceleration times need to be done in Excel (may need enough points for a best-fit graph), illustrating the range of viable Tw.

    All calculations are to be done typed into Powerpoint or any presentation slides. A full free body diagram needs to be drawn properly. Include in the Tw vs T_acc graph. Please include citations of sources of constants, figures, etc. if used, including the weight of the groceries (screenshots can do).

    Bonus points goes to those who can show the maximum possible incline the vehicle can climb from the aspect of stability as well as traction.

    Pass up by 20th November 2019.

### Calculation
#### mass
Base : 1kg

**Taking all liquid density of products = water ( 1kg/ L )**

    Groceries:
    - Enfamil A+ Baby Milk Powder Formula - Stage 2 (0.9 kg)
    - Pasar Fresh Eggs (0.55kg)
    - F&N Magnolia Fresh Milk (1kg each)
    - Khong Guan Assortment Biscuits - Haute Selection (Tin)(700g)
    - FairPrice Frozen Fresh Mixed Vegetables (1kg)
    Link : https://www.fairprice.com.sg/
***Total mass ( kg )*** = 1+0.9+0.55+1+0.7+1 = 5.15kg
