* distance between the inner wheels
* stress of the links of the tracks
* Tracks alternating patterns of materials
* position of power shaft
* Efficiency of energy usage of tanks
* slip of tracks from the wheels
* Movements to take account for
* Drifting?
* Recovery of tracks when slip
* Modularity
* Calculation of Air Resistance **Bonus**
* Rolling Resistance
* Energy Efficiency

### Calculation

* [Tree weight approximation](https://www.warnell.uga.edu/sites/default/files/publications/WSFNR-17-33%20Coder.pdf)
* type of tree Tembusu
* [Coefficient of Static](https://structx.com/Material_Properties_007.html) might need to remove


## Vehicle Dynamics

Taking account of gravity as 9.81 m/s
