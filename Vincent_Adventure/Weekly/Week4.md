### What is a Flash   (Might need to change)
Short for Adobe Flash, Flash is software that allows users to create animated works that are saved as .FLV and can be viewed over the Internet. It was originally developed by FutureWave and known as Future Splash Animator. In 1996, it was renamed and introduced to the public as Macromedia Flash, shortly after Macromedia purchased the product. Later, Adobe announced plans to purchase Macromedia, which was finalized and completed by the end of 2005.
Flash, a popular authoring software developed by Macromedia, is used to create vector graphics-based animation programs with full-screen navigation interfaces, graphic illustrations, and simple interactivity in an antialiased, resizable file format that is small enough to stream across a normal modem connection.
