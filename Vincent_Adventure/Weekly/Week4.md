# Week 4
## Micro Python using ESP 32
### Firmware Type
We are using a ES32-WROOM-32D   
TXS0108 (5V to 3.3V converter)


### Esp32
We got the ESP32 from [Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32864722159.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.0.0.6adf22437KMQF2&algo_pvid=59218ce0-d4fa-4c6d-96d5-f2ee9141faf3&algo_expid=59218ce0-d4fa-4c6d-96d5-f2ee9141faf3-5&btsid=5377d439-aa83-4940-a870-bc76197c661c&ws_ab_test=searchweb0_0,searchweb201602_2,searchweb201603_55).
### Setup of ESP32
When you get your hands on a brand new ESP32, you would realize that you cannot write any code into it. That is because ESP32 run through machine language. In order for the ESP32 to run micropython, we will need to flash it. Please refer to [How to Flash ESP32](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/flashing-micropython-firmware-esptool-py-esp32-esp8266/) to flash and for [Firmware for ESP32](http://micropython.org/download#esp32) firmware download.

#### Steps:
    Step 1: Download python 3.7 (Can skip if you have Python 3.7 Installed)
[Python download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

    Step 2: Open command prompt in your computer
(For windows 10): Go to search bar and type :
