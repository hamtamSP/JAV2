# Micro Python
I have been learning python for a while now. Micro python is similar to python where the code structure is more or less identical to Python
## Learning Python
Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw

I personally recommend this link to start on learning Python because he give u examples to try an apply so that I can see for myself if the code works, then understand how the flow of the code works. He covers almost all the basics of python. By providing the basics, it is up to me to continue to search for more library to explore more of what python can do. The downside of this video link is that it is a 4 hour duration tutorial. I have a short attention spend and I believe that there are many of you, who are reading this page, who have similar problems, we are not able to learn consistently for 4 hours due to time constraint etc. So I would recommend separating the video into 4 or 8 sections, making a 30 mins to 60 mins per section. This learning system might not be the most efficient for most of the people a who want to learn Python, but at least for me, it gets the jobs done.

## Thonny

* [Thonny: IDE For Teaching Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLOOWVwDftg)

There are very few tutorials in regards in using Thonny. But since Thonny uses MicroPython/python as their writing language learning the basics of python will more or less get you to where u can start off exploring more into Thonny. As for the youtube tutorials for Thonny, I would recommend watching [Python IDE Thonny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWaCl0WjNZI). It is a good that the teacher in the video shows what shortcut buttons in which you can use to boost your efficiency of your experience in Python Programming. There are times where you might get what he is doing, don't worry, I also do not get it the first time. just replay the video as few more times and try to understand it. Soon, you would get it. The tutorial is relatively short but it contains all the basic skills to learn to kick start into Thonny. 

## Code style
Whenever I write a code, I tend to put sections of my code in functions, with a name related to what the code does. By doing this, I am able to debug my code by searching through the list of functions instead of searching through the entire code. However, writing the code in functions increase the memory storage of the device, which is not efficient in terms of device memory usage. To add on, I am using up too many lines to write the code, which will slow the configuration of the device I use. to improve, I can short the lines by having a better algorithm or squeeze all the lines to one line. I priorities on readability over speed, so the only way I can increase the speed is by creating a better algorithm.
Due to the fact that I have a short memory, I comment my codes as much as possible. It is a good practice adopt by all coders.


## Space Invader Game!
Now, I will be putting what I have learn about MicroPython and BBC Microbit to a test by replicating a traditional game called
For this game, I will be using [BBC Microbit](https://microbit.org/) hardware, which comes with a built in 5x5 led matrix.
BBC Micro is design for small projects, in other words there many built in actuators like LED and sensors but it have very low memory. for this game, I will design the gam in such that player only have dodge the alien, but doesn't have to shoot them down. I will be using Thonny as my IDE to write and upload code to the BBC Microbit.

This is my Source Code

## Reflection of Space Invader Game

The game was build successfully. The problems I faced was that the BBC Microbit have less memory than that of the other hardware I used in my previous projects. With the restriction of limited memory I cannot create more functions for more clarity, as each function was consume much more memory. Well to solve this problem, I have to squeeze different codes functions together to minimize the memory spaced used. Then, to solve clarity of code, I commented as much as possible. Another problem I face is the declaration of global and local variable. I am a adequate in writing code and programs. The course in which I am currently studying helped me learn the basics of coding like, declaring variables, loops, storing etc. I am not so familiar with declaring of local and global variable. I tend to get mixed up with the variables. There are a few solutions to this particular problem that I am facing, where I just squeeze all the codes into on functions, so I do not have to worry about redefining variables. However, based on past experience, I would try to avoid using that solution as it will make me confused as I continue writing. the solution I used to solve the variables problem is that I draw the flow and what variable the local to which function etc.

## Advises
To all the people who are new to coding or already starting coding, know what you want to do and understand the flow of the coding logic. Make sure to comment major lines as much as possible. And lastly, take note and understand what went wrong with the code in your attempts.

##### NO ONE GETS THE CODE WORKING PERFECTLY WITHIN A FEW TRIES.
##### DON'T GIVE UP! KEEP ON TRYING!
