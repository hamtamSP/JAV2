## What is a Markdown?

Markdown is a simple way to add formatting like headers, bold, etc. it was design to be an easy alternative to HTML. With the help of markdown, people can create simple webpages without any experience with html, organize notes, to-do list, etc. Markdown is meant to keep documentation simple and efficient.

Markdown is created by [John Gruber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gruber) (of Daring Fireball) in 2004 in collaboration with Aaron Swartz on the syntax, with the goal of enabling people to write using an easy-to-read plain text format, then convert it to XHTML or HTML

## What is a Git?

Git is a like a smart data storage system where it take snapshot of the project files. Unlike other previous data storage systems, where they will save a copy of the project file at certain intervals of time, Git take a snapshot of the project files only when there are changes being made. Git store data like a series of snapshots of small files. Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like ,when u commit or save, and stores a reference to that snapshot instead of storing as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control). With Git's systematic way of storing backup data, git potentially increases the efficiency of data storage.

Most operations of Git is mainly done by local computer. It only need local files and resources from our computer to operate. By using the fact that Git only uses things stored in our computer, retrieving and uploading data information is almost instant! Git do not have to go out to a server to get history and display, it just read directly from the local database, just like reading a book which is located in front of you instead of going to a nearby library or book center to read a book. However, the data accessed by Git is limited to only the data stored in our computers.
