# Dispenser 1.0 (G2 - Pen Design)

## Introduction
When I was in primary school, I like to make things that wasn't meant for the purpose of the product. One of them is a G2-Pen gun, where I disassemble the used pen and reconfigure it into a projectile shooter.

For this case, I will need to reconfigure the barrel size for the sapling to fit in the loading system. I will also redesign the firing system so that the firing force will be the sapling roots and not the leaves or stem. In order to ensure that the saplings is planted firmly to the ground, the saplings will have a tiny rock(Weight) in the roots system so that dispenser will have enough force to punch the saplings into the ground.
