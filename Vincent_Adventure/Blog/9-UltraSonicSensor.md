# Ultra Sonic Sensor

In my seed planting vehicle, I am going to put an ultra sonic sensor at the front of the vehicle so that I am able to know if there is a potential danger in the path that the vehicle is about to go. The ultra sonic sensor will be places that a -20 degree parallel from the ground facing downwards. It is the stimulate if the vehicle is near a cliff or of there obstacle blocking its path
